# Contributing Guidelines

Before you start working on something, see if it's something that we agree should be worked on by [joining our IRC channel](https://qchat.rizon.net/?channels=ayaseproject) (preferred) or [opening an issue](https://github.com/ayaseproject/ayase/issues/new) (be sure to search for it first!).

Don't know Rust? That's fine. Feel free to help by contributing ideas and documentation.

## Conventions

Try and stick to [this style guide](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/blob/master/guide/guide.md), but just treat it as a recommendation.

## Testing

If you implement a new feature, try to make some tests for it.

## Using git

Format commit messages using the [Conventional Commits](http://conventionalcommits.org/) specification. The allowed types are [the ones Angular uses](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#type).

The git commit history is not to be edited except to ensure that the commit message conventions are followed.
